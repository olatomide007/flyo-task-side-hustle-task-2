Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<div class="card email-sec">

### Continued development

-I want to know what to consider most between font-size or the negative space of the sample of a website. if you see my mobile version of the task, my texts are not aligned equally with the sample given to us to follow that is because i didnt change font size given to us whuich is 14px. if i had changed it, my texts would be aligned equally but with equal font size. 
- i want work on css grid
- how to style a input [title]:hover and so on.
